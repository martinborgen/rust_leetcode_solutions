These are my solutions to problems on the Leetcode webpage. 
They're small and fun, I do them as nice little excercises, similar to crosswords or sodokus. 

The problems are enumerated. I'm not always copyign the problem statement into the solution file, but the full description is available at the leetcode page. 
For instance, lc_100_something means it is leetcode problem #100. 

By nature of how the leetcode webpage works, all solutions are implementations on the Solution -struct. The main() -functions in the files are my own tester functions.
